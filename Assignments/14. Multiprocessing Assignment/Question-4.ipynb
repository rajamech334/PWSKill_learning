    "A multiprocessing pool in Python is a way to create a pool of worker processes that can be used to perform tasks in parallel. The multiprocessing.Pool class provides a simple way to create and manage a pool of worker processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a multiprocessing pool, you create an instance of the Pool class, specifying the number of worker processes to create. You can then submit tasks to the pool using the apply(), apply_async(), map(), or map_async() methods, and the pool will automatically distribute the tasks among the worker processes in the pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of using a multiprocessing pool is that it allows you to easily parallelize tasks that can be run independently of each other. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for CPU-bound tasks that can benefit from parallel processing"
