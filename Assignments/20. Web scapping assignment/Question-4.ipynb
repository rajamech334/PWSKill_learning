    "In the context of a web scraping project, Flask can be used to build a web application that provides a user interface for inputting search queries or other parameters, and then displays the scraped data in a user-friendly format. Flask can also be used to handle data storage and retrieval, as well as to handle user authentication and other security concerns."
