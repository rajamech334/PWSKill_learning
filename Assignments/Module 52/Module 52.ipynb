    "    \n",
    "        Overfitting occurs when a model learns the details and noise in the training data to the extent that it performs poorly on unseen data. Essentially, the model is too complex and fits the training data very well but fails to generalize to new, unseen data\n",

    "    Consequences:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        1. Poor Generalization: The model may have high accuracy on training data but poor performance on validation or test data.\n",
    "        2. Increased Variance: The model's predictions can be highly sensitive to small changes in the input data.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Mitigation Strategies:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        1. Regularization: Techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization add penalties for larger coefficients in the model, helping to reduce complexity.\n",
    "        2. Cross-Validation: Use methods like k-fold cross-validation to ensure that the model performs well across different subsets of the data.\n",
