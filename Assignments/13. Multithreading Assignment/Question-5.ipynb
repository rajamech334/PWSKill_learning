    "Ans) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased performance: Multithreading can improve the overall performance of a program by allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously on different threads. This can be particularly useful in CPU-bound applications that can benefit from parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsiveness: Multithreading can make an application more responsive to user input by allowing certain tasks to run in the background while the user interface remains active and responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource sharing: Multithreading can allow multiple threads to share resources such as memory, file handles, and network sockets, which can reduce resource consumption and improve efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Multithreading can be used to divide a large program into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be developed and tested independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased complexity: Multithreading can add significant complexity to a program, particularly when dealing with synchronization and resource sharing issues. This can make code more difficult to write, debug, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased memory consumption: Multithreading can increase the memory requirements of a program by requiring additional memory to store thread-related data structures and context-switching overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization overhead: Multithreading requires synchronization mechanisms to ensure that multiple threads do not access shared resources simultaneously, which can result in additional overhead and reduced performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging difficulties: Multithreading can make it more difficult to debug a program because of the increased complexity and the potential for race conditions and deadlocks."
