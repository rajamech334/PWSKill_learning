    "A Series and a DataFrame are mutable in nature in Pandas, while a Panel is considered to be a deprecated data structure and has been removed from the latest version of Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a mutable data structure, the values in the object can be modified after the object has been created. For example, you can change the value of a particular element in a Series or a DataFrame by assigning a new value to the corresponding index or column. However, it's important to note that modifying the data in a DataFrame or Series can also have unintended consequences, so it's recommended to make a copy of the original data before making any changes."
