    "\n",
    "    1.1 Ordinal encoding is used when the categorical data has an inherent order or ranking. It converts each category into a corresponding integer based on its rank.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.2 The encoded values represent a meaningful order. For example, \"Low\" < \"Medium\" < \"High\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.3 It is used when the categorical variable reflects an order or hierarchy between categories, and the numerical values assigned to each category are meant to convey this order.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.1 Label encoding is used when the categorical data is nominal (i.e., it has no inherent order). It assigns a unique integer to each category.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.2 The encoded values have no inherent order. The integers are merely labels to represent different categories.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.3 It is used when the categorical variable represents categories that do not have a natural order, and the numerical values assigned are just identifiers.\n",

    "\n",
    "    1.2 Example: You have a survey with responses like [\"Strongly Disagree\", \"Disagree\", \"Neutral\", \"Agree\", \"Strongly Agree\"]. These responses have an inherent order, so you should use Ordinal Encoding to reflect that.\n",
