    "Document-oriented data model: MongoDB uses a flexible document data model, which allows for the storage of complex and hierarchical data structures, including arrays, sub-documents, and key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less design: Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB does not require a fixed schema, allowing for greater flexibility in data modeling and changes to the schema over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "High performance: MongoDB is designed to handle high volumes of data with low latency and high throughput, making it ideal for real-time applications and large-scale data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB offers horizontal scalability by distributing data across multiple servers, allowing it to handle large-scale applications with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "High availability: MongoDB supports replica sets, which ensure high availability and fault tolerance by maintaining multiple copies of data across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic sharding: MongoDB can automatically partition data across multiple servers, making it easier to scale horizontally and distribute data across multiple nodes."
