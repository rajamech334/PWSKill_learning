The order  in which the clauses in queries are executed is as follows:

1. FROM/JOIN: The FROM and/or JOIN clauses are executed first to determine the data of interest.

2. WHERE: The WHERE clause is executed to filter out records that do not meet the constraints.

3. GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause is executed to group the data based on the values in one or more columns.

4. HAVING: The HAVING clause is executed to remove the created grouped records that donâ€™t meet the constraints.

5. SELECT: The SELECT clause is executed to derive all desired columns and expressions.

6. ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is executed to sort the derived values in ascending or descending order.

7. LIMIT/OFFSET: Finally, the LIMIT and/or OFFSET clauses are executed to keep or skip a specified number of rows.
