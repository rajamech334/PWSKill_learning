    "Multiprocessing is a Python module that allows the creation and management of processes, which are separate instances of a program that can run concurrently with each other. This module provides a way to take advantage of multi-core processors in order to speed up the execution of CPU-intensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is useful because it allows a Python program to take advantage of the full processing power of a computer, instead of being limited to a single core. This can significantly improve the performance of certain types of applications, such as those that involve large amounts of data processing or numerical calculations."
