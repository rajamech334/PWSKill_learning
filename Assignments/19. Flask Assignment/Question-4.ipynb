    "Ans) \n",
    "In Flask, templates are used to generate HTML pages dynamically. A template is a file that contains placeholders for dynamic data, such as variables, conditional statements, and loops. When a Flask application receives a request, it uses a template to generate an HTML page that is sent back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dynamic HTML generation: Templates allow you to generate HTML pages dynamically, based on data that is passed from your Flask application to the template.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Code reuse: Templates allow you to reuse code across multiple pages in your Flask application. This can save you time and reduce code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Separation of concerns: Templates allow you to separate the presentation logic (HTML) from the business logic (Python) of your Flask application. This can make your code more organized and easier to maintain."
